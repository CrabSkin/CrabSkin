Introduction

Among the stories with which I have most connected, the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (1987) franchise holds a dear place in my heart. With its sense of humor, pacing, action, characters, and world, this anthology anime has taken me as a viewer from laughter, tears, and glory in the blink of an eye.

Within its worldbuilding, "Stands," introduced in Part 3 of the series (1989), are the magic/power system that the characters, whether heroes or villains, preferentially possess. These beings are defined as "physical manifestations of a person's life energy" (the Stand user). They have diverse appearances, but are still categorized into 5 types: Natural Humanoid (NH), Artificial Humanoid (AH), Natural Non-Humanoid (NNH), Artificial Non-Humanoid (ANH), and Phenomenon (PH).

Entendido. Aquí tienes la traducción al inglés de ese texto:

Furthermore, their abilities are reflected in superpowers as varied as the brilliant mind of their author allows, but in turn, these can be summarized into 6 conventional parameters: Destructive Power (PWR), Speed (SPD), Range (RNG), Stamina (STA), Perception (PRC), Development Potential (DEV).

In this way, and in light of the more than 30 years that the franchise has existed, I asked myself:
Are there patterns in the design of the stands in terms of their abilities?

Objectives
Develop a clean, homogeneous, and processable database on the stands.
Describe the profiles of the variables within the database.
Determine if there are significant correlations and differences in the statistics of the stands in relation to:
Season (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8).
User Gender (Masculine, Feminine, Unidentified).
User Affiliation (Ally, Antagonist, Neutral).
Stand Form (NH, AH, NNH, ANH, PH).

Questions
What is the distribution of Stands throughout the different parts of Jojo's?
Is there any trend in the power levels of the Stands throughout the seasons?
Is there any Stand form that is more common among certain types of users (e.g., allies vs. antagonists)?
Is there any correlation between the statistics?

Tools and Resources
Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets
SQL in Big Query
R Studio in Posit Cloud

Database
First, I downloaded a database of the stands with official statistics to date from Kaggle.com. It contains 156 records. Then, using the Wikis "JoJo's Bizarre Encyclopedia" and "JOJOPEDIA," I loaded variables such as the season where the Stand was shown (series_part), user gender (user_gender), user affiliation (user_affiliation), and stand form (stand_form).

Cleaning and Transformation

I encountered the particular challenge of encoding the ability levels and transforming them from ratings to numerical values.

Ability levels are typically rated using letters from "E" to "A," but there are exceptions under the categories of "None" and "Infinite." This latter value makes it difficult to transform the ordinal level of measurement to a metric/ratio level of measurement for obvious reasons.

For this reason and others, I decided to exclude some cases from the final database.

Inclusion Criteria

Only the following were added:

Stands with official statistics.
Belonging to the main series, not novels, one-shots, etc.
Stands exclusively with statistics: A, B, C, D, E, and None. Those with "Infinite" level statistics are not included because they cannot be transformed into numerical values.
Repeated Stands, as their statistical expression varies according to the series_part, technically making them distinct Stands.

Analysis and Results

Descriptive Statistics

For a total of 141 records, I performed the transformation of the ability statistics columns, converting the values from "None" (0) to "A" (5). I used SQL in the Big Query console as well as Google Sheets to assign the new statistical values using VLOOKUP as tools. I also used Tableau to graph the resulting tables.
